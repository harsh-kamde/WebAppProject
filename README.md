# WebApp: Online Learning Platform 
## Introduction: 
The purpose of this project is to create a WebApp similar to Udemy where users can purchase courses and instructors can create and publish courses. The WebApp will have features such as a login system, course listing page, course details page, payment gateway, and instructor dashboard. The WebApp will be developed using Bootstrap, AJAX, PHP, and MySQL.
## Technologies Used:
The following technologies will be used in the development of this WebApp:
•	Bootstrap for front-end design and layout.
•	AJAX for asynchronous communication between the client-side and server-side.
•	PHP for server-side scripting and business logic implementation.
•	MySQL for the database management system.

## Architecture: 
The architecture of the WebApp will be based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. The application will be divided into three layers:
•	Model: This layer will contain the business logic and data access layer of the application.
•	View: This layer will contain the front-end design and user interface of the application.
•	Controller: This layer will contain the logic for controlling the flow of the application.

## Database Schema: 
The following database schema will be used for the WebApp:
1.	Users: This table will contain the details of the registered users.
2.	Courses: This table will contain the details of the available courses.
3.	Enrollments: This table will contain the details of the courses that users have enrolled in.
4.	Payments: This table will contain the details of the payments made by users for purchasing the courses.
5.	Videos: This table will contain the details of the videos uploaded by instructors for their courses.
6.	Course Progress Table: This table will contain the details of the course progress of the users.

## Pages and Wireframes:
The following pages will be developed for the WebApp along with their respective wireframes:
•	Home Page: This page will contain the details of the WebApp and the available courses.
•	Login Page: This page will be used for the users to login to their account.
•	Registration Page: This page will be used for new users to register their account.
